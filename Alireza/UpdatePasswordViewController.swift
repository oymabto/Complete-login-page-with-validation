                // [weak self] creates a weak reference to self within the closure. By doing this, you avoid a strong reference cycle between the closure and the UpdatePasswordViewController instance. If the closure were to capture a strong reference to self, it could potentially cause a memory leak if the UpdatePasswordViewController instance is deallocated while the closure is still holding a strong reference.

                // The becomeFirstResponder() method makes the oldPasswordTF (a UITextField instance) the first responder, which means it will receive user input, such as keyboard events. In practical terms, this line of code will cause the keyboard to appear and the oldPasswordTF text field to become active and highlighted when the user taps the "Try again. ðŸ˜ž" button.
